This little app will let you patch and unpatch Clash Royale app on the fly. Make sure to properly kill and restart the game after using the patcher. This will let you run proxied on your main account.

# Limitations
* There is no error handling since it's doing what it is supposed to on my android just fine. I wasn't intended to publish this so any error won't be described. It is supposed to work only on the last version of Clash Royale running on ARM device (No emulators).

# Requirements

* Android rooted
* Latest BusyBox installed from Google Player Store

# Installation

* Clone the repo
* Move dd into /system/xbin and chmod/chown it like all others system bins
* Install apk

# Usage

* Open the app and check uncheck to patch and restore
* Your proxy url will be saved and reused as default for further patches (obvs it can be changed in-app)
